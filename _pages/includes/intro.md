# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a second year PhD. candidate in [Computer Vision at the Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/computer-vision-department/) under the supervision of Dr. [Mohammad Yaqub](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9dfn5GkAAAAJ) at [BioMedia Lab](https://mbzuai-biomedia.com/biomedia/). I completed my MS in [Machine Learning at MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/machine-learning-department/) under the supervision of Dr. [Karthik Nandakumar](https://www.sprintai.org/nkarthik) and Dr. [Mohammad Yaqub](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9dfn5GkAAAAJ).
<!-- I completed my bachelor's degree in [Computer Science at Aligarh Muslim University](https://www.amu.ac.in/department/computer-science) in July 2022, advised by Dr. [Faisal Anwer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S-VW0mAAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Mohammad Nadeem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yaEgXYMAAAAJ&hl=en). -->


<!-- Previously, I interned at Sony AI for half a year, focusing on AI security and model compression. Before that, I also interned at Tencent Youtu Lab for one year, exploring federated learning and adversarial attacks. -->

<!-- **Research Interests**: I am mainly interested in data-centric AI or data-driven machine learning, including data privacy, data security, data efficiency, and data-related applications. My research investigates how to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models. Previously, I focused on the following research topics:
- Data Efficiency: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation, Dataset Condensation
- Data Security: Adversarial Examples, Model Inversion
- Data Privacy: Membership Inference Attack
- Data-related Applications: Federated Learning, Imbalanced Learning, Continual Learning -->

**Research Interests**: I am interested in AI-for-Healthcare and aim to build AI applications that are safe, robust, and deployable for downstream medical tasks. My work bridges model-centric and data-centric approaches to ensure generalizability and trust in clinical environments. Specifically:
- Efficiency: Unsupervised Adaptation, Distillation
- Trustworthiness: Adversarial Training, Test-Time Adaptation
- Domain Generalization: Model Merging, Zero-shot Generalization
- Current Focus: Robust Dermatology VLMs, LLM Merging

ü§î I'm currently involved in 3 main projects: Test-time merging on Med-LLMs, A survey on Unsupervised Functions, Low-shot generalization of Dermatology-VLM.

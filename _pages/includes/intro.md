# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a final-year MS student in [Machine Learning at the Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), under the supervision of Dr. [Karthik Nandakumar](https://www.sprintai.org/nkarthik).
I completed my bachelor's degree in [Computer Science at Aligarh Muslim University](https://www.amu.ac.in/) in July 2022, advised by Dr. [Faisal Anwer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S-VW0mAAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Mohammad Nadeem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yaEgXYMAAAAJ&hl=en).
Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at Hainan University in July 2020.

<!-- Previously, I interned at Sony AI for half a year, focusing on AI security and model compression. Before that, I also interned at Tencent Youtu Lab for one year, exploring federated learning and adversarial attacks. -->

**Research Interests**: I am mainly interested in data-centric AI or data-driven machine learning, including data privacy, data security, data efficiency, and data-related applications. My research investigates how to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models. Previously, I focused on the following research topics:
- Data Efficiency: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation, Dataset Condensation
- Data Security: Adversarial Examples, Model Inversion
- Data Privacy: Membership Inference Attack
- Data-related Applications: Federated Learning, Imbalanced Learning, Continual Learning

ü§î For my PhD study, I am currently exploring the aspects of privacy and utility associated with synthetic data, particularly the use of generative models such as GANs or Diffusion models to obtain synthetic data.
